### Small hacks applied on the following projects to get movenet detections to drive a webgl fluid simulation.
  [Pose detection](https://github.com/geaxgx/depthai_movenet)
  
  [Visualization](https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation)

You may be able to hack on MoveNet and other models with your browser/webcam.
[demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/tfjs-models/demos/pose-detection/index.html?model=movenet)

The source (and models) are at https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models.git

### Context
* This quite basic example is just to help show how one might leverage and connect ome good work out there to make something expressive and your own.
* It is not recommended to use this hacked code as a basis for any real project.

### So many cool things to look into ....

To do
- [ ] Add "How to" to get demo working on laptop
- [ ] Demo with browser/webcam detection instead of oak-d-lite
